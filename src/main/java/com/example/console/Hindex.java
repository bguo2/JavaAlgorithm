//H-index: sort the citations with descending order, if c <= index, then the index is the H-index
//Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher,
// write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
//
//According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each,
// and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."
//
//Example:
//
//Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
//Output: 3
//Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had
//             received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively.
//             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining
//             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
//Note:
//
//If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
